    <p>Do you like torturing yourself early in the morning by standing over an hour in front of the stove? <br>Well in that case, making those delicious flaps of cooked batter will be right up your alley!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>About 700ml of milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>300-350gr of flour</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp of sugar</li>
            <li>A dash of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 Tsp of baking soda</li>
            <li>Some butter or oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl whisk eggs, sugar, salt and soda. Better use a mixer.</li>
            <li>Start adding milk while still whisking.</li>
            <li>Make that mixer work while adding flour and dumping melted butter (or oil) into the mix.</li>
            <li>Check the consistency: your batter must remind you of a thick creamy kefir. If you are unfamiliar with kefir, tough luck. The batter is still very much liquid, but not runny.</li>
            <li>Heat up and grease up a pan, pour a ladle of batter in it, but don't be overzealous! The real Blinchiki thrive when they are thin and porous.</li>
            <li>See the picture above? They must look kind of like that.</li>
        </ol>
