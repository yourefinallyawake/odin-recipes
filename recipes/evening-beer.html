    <h1>Evening Beer</h1>
    <img src="./img/beer.jpg">
    <p>This balanced meal requires a bit of brain power, because you actually need to think about buying the beer a day before you decide to treat yourself.</p>
    <p>Why so? Because quite rarely do the stores have the beer properly cooled. And you're not some sorta schmuck who buys just one bottle of cooled beer from the gas station!</p>
    <p>So get ready in advance: put your six-pack in the fridge atleast 4 hours before the planned consumption.</p>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>Beer</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Steps
        <li>Get the beer out of the fridge</li>
        <li>Open it with some sort of opening device</li>
        <li>If you drink it straight out of the bottle, you won't need to wash any glasses afterwards. Just saying.</li>
        <li>Think about how many calories there are in beer. A lot. So you are not going to be needing food that evening.</li>
        <li>Cheers!</li>
    </ol>
